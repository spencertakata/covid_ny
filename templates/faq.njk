                <p><strong>Who runs this project?</strong></p>
                <p class="pr-lg-5">This initiative is entirely run by a volunteers, with a central leadership team and several local chapters. It started out of a social media plea made by a front-line nurse in Victoria, BC who was unable to find alternate housing during the outbreak to keep her family safely distanced. Soon after, word spread to other cities, and new chapters continue to form.</p>

                <p><strong>I'm not a healthcare worker, can I apply for housing?</strong></p>
                <p class="pr-lg-5">This service is primarily for healthcare workers who carry the highest risk of contracting COVID&#xfeff;-&#xfeff;19. However, we understand that all essential workers carry some risk and might be seeking temporary, low-cost housing. If you are concerned about exposing your household to COVID&#xfeff;-&#xfeff;19, we encourage you to&nbsp;apply.</p>

                <p><strong>Can I use this service to find long-term housing?</strong></p>
                <p class="pr-lg-5">Our service is only intended to support healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Property owners are listing their units at unprecedented rates in light of these extraordinary circumstances. Please do not contact property owners with the intention of securing low-cost accommodation indefinitely.</p>

                <p><strong>Can I list my unfurnished suite?</strong></p>
                <p class="pr-lg-5">At this time, we are only looking for furnished suites that healthcare workers can move into quickly and easily. You're welcome to list your unfurnished suite and leave it up to the worker's discretion as to whether or not it suits their needs.</p>

                <p><strong>Isn't Airbnb already doing this?</strong></p>
                <p class="pr-lg-5">Yes, Airbnb has started a <a href="https://www.airbnb.ca/openhomes/covid19relief" taget="_blank">COVID-19 relief program</a> for healthcare workers and first responders. Listing a property on Airbnb is an involved process that takes a number of steps. We offer a simpler and less formal process so that property owners can be connected with healthcare workers faster.</p>

                <p><strong>Aren’t hotels already offering free accommodation to healthcare workers?</strong></p>
                <p class="pr-lg-5">We applaud the generous offers made by these hotels and organizations! However, hotel rooms often lack amenities that healthcare workers need, such as a kitchen or kitchenette and laundry facilities. In addition, most hotels offering rooms are located in the downtown core, and are therefore not helpful to those who work farther out of town.</p>

                <p><strong>Can I list my condo?</strong></p>
                <p class="pr-lg-5">Condos are appropriate to list, so long as the unit itself is not shared. Common areas in the building should be kept as clean and safe as possible to prevent the spread of the virus.</p>

                <p><strong>My unit doesn’t have in-suite laundry, should I still list it?</strong></p>
                <p class="pr-lg-5">While having in-suite laundry makes it easier for healthcare workers to reduce the risk of exposure to others, a unit without it may still be helpful to healthcare workers. We encourage you to list your unit as an option for healthcare workers to consider.</p>
