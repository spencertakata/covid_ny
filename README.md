# Covid 19 support site

I built this website to connect healthcare workers who need alternative/secondary housing during the COVID-19 crisis with property owners who are willing to offer free or discounted housing.

This project is part of a volunteer initiative I found via a reddit post by the organizers. The idea started in a town in Canada, and soon others wanted to start a similar service in their city.

This website was designed to be simple, lightweight, and easily iteratable. Keeping in mind that everyone involved is busy with their day job and other responsibilities, I used Bootstrap and Nunjucks to make a standard template for adding new cities within 10 minutes.
