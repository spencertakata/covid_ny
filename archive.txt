                      <p>We request that properties be made available to healthcare workers at no cost, but at minimum that rent to be pro-rated weekly to avoid putting a burden on health care workers that are having to pay for their regular mortgage or rent in addition to the cost of separate housing.</p>
                      <p>If you are unable to provide your property at no cost, we ask that you find a compromise between market rent, and the price that staff can reasonably afford. Our suggested guideline for cost in this scenario is $1000/month for a place that has two beds, inclusive of all utilities. In this example, it could house two healthcare workers at a cost of $500 each per month.</p>
